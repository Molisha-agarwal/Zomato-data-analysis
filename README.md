# Zomato-data-analysis
This Zomato Data Analysis project explores restaurant data from Bengaluru to uncover meaningful business insights. The dataset was cleaned in Python by handling missing values, standardizing ratings, and converting cost fields into numeric formats suitable for analysis. Exploratory data analysis was then used to study restaurant distribution by location, popularity of different cuisines, and patterns in ratings, cost for two, and votes. An interactive one-page Power BI dashboard was built to visualize key metrics such as total restaurants, average rating, average cost, and total votes. The dashboard highlights top locations and cuisines, compares average rating by location, and analyzes the impact of features like online ordering and table booking on customer ratings. These insights can help restaurant owners and aggregators understand competition, identify high-potential areas, and design better pricing and service strategies.
